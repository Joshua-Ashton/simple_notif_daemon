# Simple Notification Daemon

This very simple notification daemon example prints any notifications to stdout.

This project is simply to serve as a very simple, cut down example on how to implement a notif daemon.

A lot of code was taken from [Mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako).
Check out that project if you want a fully featured notif daemon for Wayland!
